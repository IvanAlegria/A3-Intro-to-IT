                <h3>Ron Shaharit, s3185905:</h3>
              <p> My Name is Ron Shaharit. I am originally from Israel, and I moved to Australia at the end of 2009. Hebrew is my first language and English is my secondary language. I am a Fourth-year student studying Bachelor of Engineering Civil and Infrastructure (Honours) at RMIT University. I have also completed my first internship as a Vocational Student Engineer at Port of Melbourne. My hobbies mainly revolve around basketball, gaming and occasionally beach volleyball.
              My interest in IT started when my friends were teaching me about computer parts. From learning about the externals of how laptops and computers work, I developed an eventual interest in learning code.
              IT skills I currently possess include using CAD drawing systems, digital animation/art, and a strong familiarity with all Microsoft Office applications. .</p><br>

              <h3>Personality Profile - Ron</h3>

<p>For me, these test results highlight some of my good traits which may have led to a protagonist outcome. Throughout my time in a variety of team situations, I tend to get input from others around me as well as try to help to reach the goal. Being involved with a positive mindset tends to affect others in the group to try their hardest in achieving the desired outcome.The outcome of the education planner learning style test (Educationplanner.org, 2011) is “visual learner”. This in my opinion is a good description of how I learn both university material and other activities such as piano and drawing. I find it much easier to draw diagrams or watch tutorials to understand things well. When I start most new things, I tend to watch the same lesson multiple times before I can achieve a similar level of understanding as displayed by the teachers. Having members who are open about what they are most comfortable with is the best path when looking to complete the group projects ahead. This should be taken into consideration when discussing members' roles in group meetings. When forming a group, I tend to look for people with different skill sets that help to cover the group's weaknesses. For example, some may be stronger encoding whilst others enjoy writing or designing websites. I hope that the team in this unit can work well as a group to complete the assignments scheduled ahead throughout the semester.

<h3>Anin Cotton, s3858565:</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Anin Cotton and my Student E-Mail is s3858565@student.rmit.edu.au. Born from an Australian/Vietnamese background; completed VCE, Advanced Diploma of Engineering Technology Bachelor of International Studies (Development) - undertaking Languages: English Vietnamese Indonesian basic HTML. Hobbies include; skateboarding, music, volleyball and gaming. Fun fact I've travelled to every state in Australia. My earliest recollections that sparked my interest in IT stem from my fond memories of playing crash bandicoot on my original Xbox console. Gaming soon became a big part of my early life and followed me throughout as I would eagerly await newer generation consoles. Around high school is when my love for gaming and all things IT started to fade and my interests moved elsewhere with my friend groups. Since I have kept my interest in IT to myself and in my own time dabbled in things such as video editing, music production, gaming (again), PC building and so on. </p><br>

<h3>Personality Profile - Anin</h3>

<p>The Myers-Briggs test I found especially resonated a lot with my outlook on life and my held values/beliefs. It explained how I can be an effective leader given my pursuit to do what is right and often go out of my way to help others and try to make the world a better place. However, along with this personality type it depicts as also being prone to being unrealistic, overly empathetic and at times too straightforward. Given this alluded to a sense of leadership I decided to take a separate online test to gauge my leadership style finding that I border on being a democratic/participative and a laissez-faire style leader. As for my learning style, the test considered me a visual learner which I agree with.
In all, these results tell me that I am a passionate and reliable person who can lead a team but with a tendency to do so in a more relaxed cooperative manner who takes on information visually and by doing.
I think with these results I will be more aware of my weaknesses and strengths and use this information in a way so that I can best contribute to the team.
When forming a team, I think it is important to get people who may have strengths different to my own so that we can have a well-rounded team.

<h3>Kelvin Nguyen, s3946309:</h3>

<p>Hello, my name is Kelvin Nguyen, I can be contacted through my RMIT email, which is s3946309@student.rmit.edu.au.I am currently 18 years old, studying a bachelor’s course in Information Technology after completing a year 12 and VCE at Mazenod College in 2021. I was born in Melbourne Victoria in 2003, after both my parents fled Vietnam through a refugee camp in Malaysia. My family consists of my mother, father, my older sister, and a cat that the family adopted last year. Both my parents are Vietnamese, and the entire household mainly speaks Vietnamese, but my sister and I only know how to speak the language. My interest in IT sparked from a very young age using technology such as a home desktop computer and tablets, which has extended into today as now I own and maintain a custom-built pc. The use of different kinds of programs and gaming has also greatly contributed to my growing interest in IT, specifically in the coding/programming side of it</p><br>

<h3>Personality Profile - Kelvin</h3>

<p>The results of the Myers-Briggs test suggest that I can be the mediator between people, as it says that I am open-minded about aspects people bring forth.
The learning style test displays that I am geared towards visual learning, meaning I can pick up skills mainly through observation.
The Big 5 Personality test’s top two traits line up with the results of the Myers-Briggs test, showing that I am open and agreeable to others.
These tests suggest that I can keep the team I am in on track with the assignment and can hear out the opinions of others when working and before making a decision rather than always relying on myself. This displays that I am capable of working with the majority of people I will be matched up with.</p>

<h3>Albert Mathew, s39475100:</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Albert Mathew, I was born in the southern part of India, Kerala; to two Malayalam speaking parents and an older sister. Currently living near Cranbourne studying Bachelor of IT; graduated from Salesian College in 2021. My hobbies include but are not limited to playing Valorant, casual football (soccer) and listening to music, however, most of my time is spent watching movies or YouTube. I once had two pet birds however … one died from a wild bird while the cage was left outside and the other one … flew away not too long after that. My interest in IT was inspired and cultivated through my general interest in the technology that surrounds us every day from the smart tv in the living room to the small device in our hands that connects us to the entire world through a couple of clicks. However, the flexibility and freedom the IT world offers were also a major contributor to my decision, the luxury to work at home or work while travelling allures me to this field. </p><br>

<h3>Personality Profile - Albert</h3>

<p>This is an accurate representation of my personality as a virtuoso is someone who learns and explores the world through their eyes, touching and examining. People with this personality type are natural Makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it, and learning from their environment as they go (Introduction | Virtuoso (ISTP) Personality | 16Personalities, 2022), which embodies my take on life, as I am someone who doesn't want to the same place every day and see the same people and do the same job. However, the results from learning styles are far from the truth as the test ensued to labelling me as a visual learner. Visual learners are people who understand through reading or seeing pictures and remember things by sight. I always found myself to be more of a tactile learner who learns through repeated physical action; a “firsthand” person. This test has some inaccuracy with its questioning and database as it falsely categorized me as a visual learner. Finally, the big five tests label which I had the highest raw score in agreeableness, which is a trait describing friendliness and optimism, I feel as though I am more of a realistic and down to earth person trying to get by each day; this could indicate a flaw within the algorithm for this test.
When forming a team, I think I should just collaborate with people who have a vision of what they want to achieve but also an open mind to others' input and opinions, and pair with others who are like-minded but can formulate ideas for practical applications. But find people whom I enjoy working together with and who have similar tastes so that we can cultivate ideas better</p>

<h3>Ivan Alegria, s3849118:</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Ivan Alegria, I was born and raised in Manila, Philippines and moved to Australia in 2014. I am currently in my third year of studying Information Systems majoring in Business Information Systems at RMIT University. I am interested in learning other languages, currently, I know how to speak Filipino, English, Korean and Japanese. I also have a passion for street photography as a way to relieve stress. I hope to continue to build and improve the current skills required to excel in real-life experiences. I became interested in Information Technology as I was always surrounded by technology whether it be by going on the computer, playing games, or watching tv. In addition, having both parents working in the fields of IT further increased my interest in the area. </p><br>

<h3>Personality Profile - Ivan</h3>

<p>For me, these tests are a way to further analyse and understand my personality, habits, and in what situations I work best. By having visualisation and a written report about my strengths and weaknesses, I can work towards reducing my weaknesses.Having these results could influence behaviour as you are aware of what your strengths are when cooperating with other individuals and become more mindful of whether your workflow can apply to everyone in the group or would you have to collectively think of a way to work effectively. When forming a team it would be best to have people with similar habits and working styles to finish projects effectively. In comparison having people with different ways of working makes it difficult for other members to work properly together. A variety of in-group members should also be considered as well as their strengths and weaknesses so that other members can cover for the weaknesses of other members.</p>

<h3>Altaf Hossain, s3805753:</h3>
<p>My Name Is Altaf Hossain. I am from Bangladesh. I am an undergraduate of Information Technology. I can speak four languages. Bengali being my mother tongue, I learned Hindi & Urdu in my early childhood by watching cartoons on TV & lastly English because it was one of the important subjects in school. I love listening to music & watching movies in my idle time. One interesting fact about me is when I listen to music, I get this urge to memorize the lyrics. As a result, I know countless song lyrics. In childhood, I loved chatting with my friends. Back then it was Face to Face. As the years went by those chats became texts. One of the things that caught my attention when I got my phone was how quickly someone is getting my words no matter where they are in the world not to mention without any strings attached to it. I loved the fact that not only does IT make us bring people closer but also creates a new realm to explore tons of new stuff. </p><br>

<h3>Personality Profile - Altaf</h3>
<p>The tests describe a lot about my personality. Both 16personality and big5 test tends to tilt me to the extrovert side which is true in a way. I’m mostly agreeable if anyone can be logical about something. I’m usually logical. I do get emotional sometimes but it’s exceedingly rare. If someone can’t deliver in time, I’d listen to them before executing the decree. Lastly, I tend to be honest with the people around me but mostly with myself.
For me working as a team is all about communication, commitment & respect. It’s about doing the task as smoothly as possible without holding individual needs first. The results shown in the screenshots are a good example that my presence in the team would be a positive influence on the team. Forming a team before doing a project is essential mostly because if you do not choose the right teammates the project can be a failure. This is why it is important to have people with excellent communication skills & logic rather than emotional. </p>
<br><br>

<h3>Group Processes</h3>

<h>What went well: </h>
<p> Our team worked really well for the large majority of Assignment 2. After the first meeting everyone was aware of the sections that they had to complete as well as their deadlines which gave us a good initial start to the assignment. In assigning work, we also played to each members strengths and weaknesses so that everyone felt comfortable and confident in what they were doing. Meetings, which were held consistently on MS Teams about 2 times per week, were well organized and ran very smoothly given that we would nominate a rotating meeting leader to facilitate and hold each meeting. A final thing that went well was our ability to foster a positive and healthy team environment in which we were able to get along well in and comfortably voice any concerns or problems we may have been having. All members for the assignment’s entirety also had really good ideas and contributions. </p>

<h>What did not go well:</h>
<p>Issues for our team faced all appeared during the end of the assignment closer to the deadline. Group members struggled with completing their work within the given deadlines, which was exacerbated by a lack of consistent communication through online platforms (outside of meetings), as well as multiple technical issues with the combability/accessibility of the final shared document online. This dramatically reduced the timeframe in which we were able to properly compile, coordinate and polish our report. Furthermore, although meetings were held regularly attendance at times varied - given we struggled finding a single date/time which consistently suited all members. Fortunately, those that missed meetings would often re-watch to keep up to date with the team. A final note is that group work was quite individualistic and thus understanding of each other’s work remained limited.</p>

<h>How to improve for A3:</h>
<p>Having recognized our group weaknesses from assignment to we will be introducing changes for better group outcomes for assignment 3. We will organize better meeting times that suit all members and strive for a more consistent attendance by all. The group will also make a meaningful effort to use and communicate more on MS Teams outside of meetings so that group members are consistently aware of everyone’s progress and issues. Furthermore, as a group we will try and facilitate better collaboration in our work by working on sections as a team rather than individually and making an effort to better understand each other’s work. Of great importance, is that we adhere strictly to deadlines and alert the team aware well in advance if we have any issues. In doing so we will also allow ourselves more time nearing the end of the assignment to synthesize and format our work for a more polished and refined report. Moreover, we also need to find a more suitable collaborative platform for our final document that is compatible across all group devices and bring to the groups attention any loose tasks that need to be completed.
