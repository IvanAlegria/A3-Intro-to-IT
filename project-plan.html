                <h1>Project<span> Plan</span></h1>
                <!-- short description of page -->
                <h2>Topic</h2>
                <!-- information/body -->
                <p>For this project, our team proposes to develop a ‘2d top-down shooter game using the application GameMaker Studio’. The objective of this project is to successfully plan and put together a fully functional game which implements a wide variety of features and game mechanics that can rival similar games in the top-down shooter genre. In addition to coordinating and illustrating a 2d game aesthetic and sound design that would be appealing to consumers in the target market which potentially become a competitive advantage coupled with the game mechanics against other games released in the market.
                Based on the ‘top-down shooter’ genre the developed game would be positioned to target a niche audience who have an interest in bullet hell style and fast-paced gameplay. And follows the popular 2d art style trend of most well-known shooter games released in the market </p>

                <h2>Motivation</h2>

                <p>The team’s main reason and motivation to take up this project was our interest and passion for games. The thought of being able plan and learn the process of how games are created from start to finish made the project interesting. Process such as learning how applications like GameMaker are utilised to program certain game mechanics and features. Developing the story of the game and illustrating a game design that effectively displays the characters and story of the script. Sound design which can change the whole vibe and immersion of the player when playing the game. And above all, the thought of being able to actually materialise a properly working game that individuals can enjoy had inspired the team. (…) Additionally by undergoing this project, it can provide the team with new skills, knowledge, and skills that can potentially be used in the game development industry. And may potentially give an advantage during employment against other individuals who are new to the industry and have no experience.
                </p>

                <h2>Landscape</h2>

                <p>There are various competitors that our game would go up against on its release in the market. New games such as ’10 Minutes Till Dawn’ to older well-known shooters like ‘Nuclear Throne’ and ‘ Enter the Gungeon’. These would become a hurdle for our game, as games made by competitors are from big game companies and or indie developers have already created a fan base and are well known withing the top-down genre, making it difficult for newer indie developer like us to enter the market effectively. To do so we have integrated popular mechanics and features used by popular games such as the ability to ‘dash’. In addition to adding new features those other competitors have not implemented like the ability to ‘jump’, allowing the player to avoid enemy fire and get across obstacles by jumping. Doing so will give a competitive advantage against other games by having a new mechanic that cannot be found in other games and potentially increase potential customer base.</p>

                <h2>Aims</h2>

                <p> Our project aim is to construct a playable presentation demo level that showcases the basic visual, functional, mechanical, (audible) elements of our 2d Top-Down Shooter game, ‘Grounded Plains’, accompanied by a game lore/script and concept drawings to clarify our finalised game vision.<br><br>

                Listed below are some of the goals we have set out to accomplish our overarching aim. These aims cover a range of the tangible artifact elements we aim to present as part of our proposed project mentioned above.<br><br>
                Certain artifacts mentioned below will be be prioritised given its importance to the project itself, to which I will discuss in more detail below.<br><br> </p>

                <h3>Game Story Aims:</h3>

<p>We wanted to present our prototype alongside a game/lore script that would give people a much deeper understanding into our game and its narrative. This would engage people into the background context of the characters and overarching plot which we hope would motivate players to continue playing. However, we understand that this artifact only adds immersion to our foundational game and is not as crucial as other artifacts, thus have prioritised this section slightly below others in terms of importance with our limited time. As for the goals in achieving this aim we undertook:<br></p>
<p>
> Team brainstorm sessions noting down possible ideas for characters, enemies, weapons, lore, levels, ending.<br><br>

> Refining ideas and overarching game narrative <br><br>

> Create rough structure of game narrative and ideas <br><br>

> Write up an in-depth storyline for game intro & level one (mine level) <br><br>

> Write brief backstory for other levels <br><br><br>
</p>

<h3>Visual Element Aims: <br></h3>
<p>
Our group prioritised this section highly amongst our project given the visual elements of a game play a very large role in player engagement and enjoyment. In saying this we spent a lot of our time designing concept art and in-game 8-bit character models to make sure our prototype was eye-catching and aligned with a lot of the themes mentioned in our story lore/outline. Without visual elements we felt our protype would be quite plain and not engaging. The goals we set out include: <br><br>
</p>
<p>
Concept Art:<br><br>

Design, Sketch and Colour <br><br>

> Level 1 Mine Enemies <br><br>

> Mine bat <br><br>

> Mine rat <br><br><br>



Level 1 Mine Weapons <br><br>

> Pickaxe <br><br>

> Hatchet <br><br>

> Extending Drill <br><br>

> Futuristic Rifle <br><br><br>

Sketch up and colour opening game cutscene still  (Tunnel Collapse)<br><br>

Sketch up and colour final Mine Level cutscene still (Worm Boss)<br><br><br>
</p>

<h3>In-Game Art:<br><br></h3>
<p>
Main Character <br><br>

> Design/draw 8-bit Main Character model (IRIS) <br><br>

> Draw up different models for running & idle animations <br><br>

> Splice animation frames together to create moving model artifact <br><br><br>


Mine Rat (Enemy)- Not included in playable demo <br><br>

> Design/draw 8-bit Mine Rat model (based off concept art) <br><br>

> Draw up different models for running & idle animations <br><br>

> Splice animation frames together to create moving model artifact <br><br><br>



Start Screen <br><br>

> Design start screen and respective colour scheme <br><br>

> Include start button, exit button, music on/off button and game title. <br><br>

> Draw up on 8-bit drawing programs <br><br><br>
</p>


<h3>Level Design/Programming Aims:</h3><br>
<p>
Of equal importance and priority than that of our Visual Artifacts was the level design/programming itself. This is also a crucial component that underpins the projects entirety and without it we would not have a working protype to present. We wanted to make our level be functional to the extent that a player would gain a good understanding of the game’s fundamental mechanics (e.g. moving, shooting, enemy, death, etc.). The goals for this aim include:<br><br>
</p>
<p>
> Brainstorm session on level design, unique elements, characters, enemies, weapons, etc.<br><br>

> Decide on suitable software<br><br>

> Learn Game-Maker software basics<br><br>

> Plan level design & Mechanics<br><br>

> Find Sprites and configure/assign<br><br>

> Background<br><br>

> Weapon<br><br>

> Main Character<br><br>

> Enemies<br><br>

> Obstacles/Objects<br><br>

> Plot game instances/objects<br><br>

> Program character and enemy movement<br><br>

> and collision sequence<br><br>

> Program weapon and appropriate functions<br><br>

> Add sounds<br><br>

> Add game start screen<br><br>

> Add menu music (ask Anin)<br><br>

> Code game to restart and present start screen<br><br><br>
</p>


<h3>Sound Design Aims:</h3> <br>
<p>
Of lowest priority of our goals was adding audible elements to our prototype. We aim to only invest time into achieving these goals once other sections are completed. We have not made this aim a priority as we believe it only adds to our prototype and is not fundamental to its overall functionality or enjoyability.
</p>
<p>
> Brainstorm sound genre/style for title screen<br><br>

> Find sounds for weapons (and possibly movement, enemies and level 1 background music) <br><br>

> Draft possible music in garageband<br><br>

> Present to game programmer for implementation <br><br>
</p>

<h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
 <h3>Anin</h3>
<p>The initial progress I made for our project was in brainstorming and planning how the work would be split across our group. I soon realised that many areas of the project intersected and thus dividing the project completely at the start would cause issues later on. Instead, we focused on specific sections together (e.g. Project description & Game Artifacts) to which I began working on both the ‘Project Description’ and ‘Game Script Artefacts’. <br><br>

For the game script I brainstormed amongst the team to produce a rough/basic but unique narrative for our game. Using these ideas, myself and Ron began to produce draft copies of the script each writing down parts of the story narrative in more detail. We crosschecked our detailed ideas with each other and soon passed the task wholly to Ron given we found it was much easier for one person to write the script whilst others just proofread and approved it. <br><br>

Following this I went to work on my assigned section of the ‘Project Description’ section being specifically that of the ‘Scopes and Limitations’ sub-section. I wrote this section based on what the team had discussed as a whole up until this point, attempting to align this with what could practically be expected. Following my initial draft of this section I needed to cross check what I had wrote with the game development team to ensure we all shared the same understanding as to our project’s overall scope and limitations.<br><br>


Alongside writing this section, I took the initiative to complete the ‘Team Profile’ section in its entirety. In doing so I often referred to much of the content from our previous A2 report, making sure to discuss with all members if things aspects such as member’s ideal jobs/career plans had changed, whilst also refining our previous content based on the few requirements we may have missed in our team profile of A2. In discussing our ‘Group Processes’ I also referred to our team talks and comments about our weaknesses and shortfalls in A2 and the ways in which we could improve upon these moving forward for A3. <br><br>


Currently I am also drafting up the ‘Aims’ sub-section that falls under the ‘Project Description’. Here I have listed out the overall aims of our project as discussed already in-depth during team meetings, as well as the smaller goals we individually need to achieve to successfully reach these larger aims. This also required me to double check all goals and aims with members so that we are all on the same page, and to ensure individual goals have not changed. <br><br>


As one of the report-writing team members I further took on completing the ‘Tools & Technologies’ section which requires me to communicate with each member of the team to gather information about what software/hardware/programs/tools/etc. they used for A3 and how. Once gathered I hope to present this information in an understandable and clear manner. <br><br>


Once the report writing team has collected all the contextual information, we need we will take on the duty of uploading and formatting a majority of the written data into a clear and engaging report that will be finalised and proofread by all before final submission. <br><br>


Throughout the projects entirety I communicated with other members regularly on MS Teams and often drafted, backed up and uploaded my work through Google Docs, and MS Teams. <br><br>


Furthermore, to contribute an additional artifact to the game in my free time during the day I developed a short 8-bit audio loop on GarageBand as possible title screen music for our game. <br><br>


I plan to make myself available as much as possible to aid other members and also get all my tasks done within deadlines to ensure our project is ready for proofreading and formatting well before the due date. <br><br></p>

<h3>Albert</h3>
<p>
During the start of the assignment three period it was decided that the project would continue to be the 2D top down shooter derived from Ivan’s original plan, from which the story that the main character was an alien who crash landed on earth due to the internal conflict that rose from two factions on his home planet. Now stuck on earth he is faced with enemies that obstruct him from reaching his planet. This story was collectively culminated by the group and refined by Ron who scripted the final lore. As I was not interested in the game development section it was clear that report writing is where I should focus.  <br><br>

To begin with I started to format and layout the report structure and template for ease of use later when the workload was done and only the report was left to complete. Without worrying about the aesthetic and visual part of the report it was easier to focus on the actual writing and information. Although there were some struggle with the formatting as Word was not compatible for shared use, it was evident the this would pose some challenges when collating the report. Nevertheless, it was quickly resolved by the decision that one person would construct the report to avoid any technological difficulties.<br><br>

Subsequently, the task of writing the risks section was assigned to me, which required me to consider the dangers and possible mishaps that may occur during the project’s lifetime. Aside from the basic risks such as the software chosen was difficult to learn, some features weren’t as described, and the time limit placed on this assignment; it turned out that it was difficult to conjure up risks that might happen. It was later revealed that risks could include what we could be experiencing in the future outside of the assignment, making it much more feasible to write about.  <br><br>

Consequently, the next task was the group reflection was when without any hiccups; as all there was too it was what went well, what could be improved, at least one thing that was surprising and at least one thing that you have learned about groups. Similarly, group process and communication were another area I was tasked with, this section outlined the communication aspect of the group, answering question like how will your group communicate? How often will meetings take place? Will these be face-to-face or using technologies. Fairly straightforward as well no obstacles were found when completing this. <br><br>
</p>

<h3>Ivan</h3>

<p>To start of the project we had planned a meeting in which we distributed equal workload for each team member. During week one, I wrote the project idea’s overview which includes the topic, motivation, and landscape. I wrote most of the content based of the recently submitted assignment 2 where I worked on writing the project idea. Along with some additional research to identify possible competitors our project may come up against and how we may be able to compete against them. <br><br>



After the team members responsible for the script has developed a rough draft, I went to have a read through of the game’s script and illustrated the concept art for the game’s main character which is wearing a space suit. I went about drawing the character in 2d pixels with minimalistic design as I wanted the game to have a nice pixelized aesthetic. Basing the suit colours of real life space suits which used a greyish white, blue and red. After finishing the concept art I then started animating the character’s idle animation which looks like a simple bounce, as well as the running animation.<br><br>



Once our team member Ron has finalised the concept art for the enemies, I then started to illustrate the final 2d models and animations that are to be used in the final game version. As the concept art has lots of detail, I had to minimalise the design so that it can fit a small canvas whilst still having resemblance to the original concept. The animation of the ‘mole rat’ was also a simple bounce with its tail moving, however animating the ‘mine bat’ took a more significant amount of time as the way bats flap their wings is more complex, I needed to draw up more frames to display a smooth flying animation.   <br><br>



I then went on to draw up the weapons from the concept art and wrote about the applications I used in tools and technologies which included clip studio paint, photoshop, and my own personal experience with the software. In addition to writing about ‘game illustrator’ in the roles section of the report.  <br><br>



Recently I have just finished making the final textures for the walls and entrance for the game. Basing the design of the level concept art created by Ron. Which seemed like a dark coloured brick texture. Initially I had the textures squared off when I first drew them, however thought that if it was implemented into the game, it would look very blocky and unnatural. So I had to redo all walls to have texture along the sides, creating a separate asset for each wall direction. Furthermore, I then quickly sketched and coloured an illustration of the worm boss emerging from the ground. Which we had recently discussed in our previous meeting that we plan to use two drawing, one for the intro scene, and one for the boss scene, which Ron and I respectively were responsibly for. After I have finished the illustration, I used an online pixelating tool in which I can upload a png file and the website automatically pixelates the image. As to why I didn’t draw the illustration in pixels in the first place, is that it would take a greater amount of time as I am not experienced in pixel art.
<br><br>

Throughout the group project I believe that I effectively communicated and collaborated with other members on MS Teams, providing updates on work done as well as uploading all the illustrations and work done on MS Teams. Although I have missed some meetings, I made sure to watch the meeting recording and do the work that is expected to be done on the deadline.<br><br> </p>

<h3>Ron</h3>

<p>Week 9:<br><br>

Week nine acted as the first week that purely focused on assignment three, the final group project idea implementation. After finishing assignment two, new roles were discussed amongst the group members However, figuring this out proved a challenge as this week was the very early phases of the project. Apart from knowing that we wanted to make a top down 2D shooter and some core mechanics the team wanted to be implemented, a story, level and character design was not discussed. Therefore, the key focus of the first week was establishing the story. This included the lore of the game, prologue protagonist motivation and eventual level progression design. Out of the teams’ members that came up with different stories, mine was chosen as the final game story concept. Thus, for the first week a rough script was constructed, discussing key area implantations mentioned above. Also, as this was based of my vision, early character design of the first enemy in act one of the scripts “mine rat” was sketched for the concept design. Also, as I had an idea for the first area enemy would look like, a complete design for the mine worm boss was designed. Important to mention that all concept art was drawn using Samsung notes and as this was my first-time drawing using a tablet, a lot of hours of drawing were done each week. Hence, my roles were established as the lead story writer, lead concept art developer, level design developer. <br><br>



Week 10:  <br><br>

By week ten, discussion on understanding the setting and the lore of the world was fleshed out. This involved the prologue, setting acts one to six and accomplishing a brief overview of the transitions of boss and exploration sections of the game. The direction of the key concept was taken as each of the six acts having five scenes which transitions between the open maps of the level. This included scenes of introducing the player to the environment, followed by first enemy encounter. Then, an exploration with letters scattered around to add depth and world building, followed by a roadblock puzzle which must be solved. Then, a free for all area, using the weapons and facing the melee and ranged characters. Lastly, encountering the boss of the area with the chase scenes occurring. Moreover, the mine rat enemy design first iterations were completed. However, this design did have a final change in week eleven. Also, the first concept design for the mine bat ranged enemy concept design began. This week also commenced a split amongst the group, with my group being the game develop team and the other being the report writing team.
<br><br>



Week 11:  <br><br>

In week eleven the rest of the acts were completed. This includes “Wasteland escape”, “Deep in the mountains”, “Clouds in the Sky”, “Seeing the stars” and “Wayback home”. Important to mention that the rest of the script was purely written by me (Ron- lead game writer) as the vision the team decided to use was based on my horrors/thriller type scenario. However, as I was writing the script some members provided feedback to make to story’s I told flow better in some ideas. Also, at this point the mine bat concept design was finalised as well as a concept level design. The level split according to light and dark areas was based on my concept of how the enemies should act in the mines. Lastly, this week the cutscene of the main character IRIS approaching the rust zone began its first iterations.   <br><br>

Week 12  <br><br>

In the last week, the last section in the script was implanted. That being the world building letters players can pick up during playtime. This includes Igor’s crew and Misha’s mission. Moreover, the cutscene mentioned in week eleven was done. This was done before the game dev’s team meeting on Thursday to discuss how the final demo level plays. The timeframe for how the project should be completed after handover was also finalised. Roles and progress as well as individual feedback and reflection was also accomplished. Most of the heavy focused was placed on finishing the artifacts and cleaning up any previous designs so that the report team can use.<br><br>  </p>

<h3>Altaf</h3>

<p>Starting of as week 10 it was up to me to write the detailed analysis on what if a businessperson tries to acquire our project and what four jobs and skills were needed for that reason.  Though I wrote it down, it was very brief. The skills were bullet points and were not detailed enough. So, I needed to work a bit more and add some extra work on my part. Which means adding more words into the report to make it more readable and approachable.  <br><br>

 Next week I was also assigned to do the testing part of the session. I did find it a bit difficult. Mostly since we were focusing on making artwork and animations. Since the project was significantly small compared to budgeted projects. It was easier for me to test the game and write it down.
<br><br>


As of week 12, I’ve done all my work including group reflections. That includes writing down, planning and progressing. About how we discussed things and developing it. What role everyone has and record it on the report.  <br><br>

Finishing writing the report on testing and lastly detailed writing on jobs and skills.<br><br> </p>

<h3>Kelvin</h3>

<p>
                As soon as we started the assignment I was assigned as the game developer which means my job was doing coding for the game since I do have some experience developing 2d games in my high school. The week assignment 3 was released I started doing my work developing the game. Since we have very less time. It was impossible to make an entire game, yet I did my best coding for the initial level and game functionality for the hero and enemies.  
<br>
I used game maker studio as the software. I did stumble upon a few problems since it was high time working in game maker studio, but I quickly learned the rope. Next week I worked on the hero and shooting I was having a bit trouble since the hero was shooting but the aim was not on point meaning he wasn’t following the cursor. 
<br>
The following week I worked in the enemy and how the enemy should follow the hero to kill him. It was easy for me coding this part since I have picked up the pace with the software. I was successful on doing it. 
<br>
This week I worked on how with the keyboard we can move the enemy. I used the usual basic gaming key W to move up. S to move down, A to move left and D to move right. Since we ran out of time, I couldn’t work on it further. If we had more time, I would have put more effort on creating structures in the level. 
                </p>


<h2>Roles</h2>

<h4>Game Development Team:</h4>

<h3>Game Illustrator (Ivan) </h3>

<p>The main role of the game illustrator is responsible for analysing the game-script or story board and sketches that can highlight the personality of the characters, enemies, and mood of the game’s environment. Then transformed the illustrated sketches into finished artworks that is to be used in the final version of the game through the use of 2D and or 3D illustration/animation software such as Blender, Photoshop, and Clip Studio Paint. <br><br>

Other responsibilities include: <br><br>

Researching references to be used in the development of models and assets of the game. <br><br>

Animating 2D illustrations <br><br>

Designing materials, textures, and ensuring that colour and art is consistent.<br><br> </p>

<h3>Lead Concept Art Designer (Ron)</h3>

<p>
As the story of a post-apocalyptic adventure was based on my concept, all the enemy design as well as item and other components were drawn by myself. As the lead concept art designer, this includes enemy, item, level and a cutscene designs. By focusing on three main enemy designs for the demo, it allowed for a lot of creative freedom. The application used is Samsung notes to draw all the designs using an s-pen and a tablet. The drawings include first iterations to the final drawings with color presentation.  </p>

<h3>Lead Story Writer (Ron) </h3>

<p>The lead story writer job was to create the final game script. This includes writing each of the acts, their perspective settings, scenes, enemy, world building environments. Other important act transitions, scene transitions, boss chase scenes, boss concepts, boss back story is illustrated. Moreover, lore items, effective weapon ideas, prologue, and alternate endings available in each pathway are also added. Lastly, the extra content of weapon box system, filter system, letter system as well as flashed out stories for act one was created.   </p>

<h3>Level Developer (Ron) </h3>

<p>The concept art of how the level should be design was created by the lead concept art based on the lead story writers’ ideas on how the exploration RUST ZONE should act. Actual pixelated implementation was done by the lead game coder.  </p>

<h3>Game Programmer (Kelvin)</h3>
<p>
My role in this assessment was of being the game developer. Making gaming codes into playable games. As the role of the game developer my focus was on 3 things. Shooting bullets. Moving away from the enemy to save the hero’s life and aiming the gun towards the enemy. As being the part of the game development group. It was a time-consuming process to attending meeting and work through it but it was a lot of fun programming the game as well.  
</p>

<br>
<h4>Report Writing Team:</h4>

<h3>Report writer / Support (Albert)</h3>

<p>The report writer essentially is responsible for composing reports in order to express the ideas and projects in an eloquent and cohesive manner that is easy to understand, which requires them to digest huge raw data or information and analyse them and converts that knowledge into a formal written report that is more practical and understandable for average readers or those of non-technical background. As such they must be able to distinguish and eliminate irrelevant or disproportionate information whilst highlighting the more significant. </p>

<h3>Report Writer / Support (Anin) </h3>

<p>As one of the three members of the ‘Report Writing Team’ I am responsible for much of the written content in the project report itself (alongside Albert and Altaf), separate from the ‘Game Development Team’ who deal primarily with the tangible artifacts of the actual project being presented.

Initially roles were not set as the team worked together to collaborate on developing the framework our game and its surrounding ideas. However, soon after we came to the realisation that too many people working on the game’s artifacts became too complicated whilst the report itself was being neglected. Thus, we formed these two distinct teams.

As a report writer I am also responsible for the consolidation and formatting of the final project report with the help of my team members. In this role I am also responsible for supporting the game development team whenever they need, just as their team is responsible for helping us when called upon.

When the bulk of the report and artifacts are finished, I expect roles to dissolve as we all come together as one unit to cross-check and tie up any loose ends anyone has missed across the entire project. </p>

<h3>Report writer / Support (Altaf)</h3>
 <p>As of one of the report writers I was responsible for doing my work on writing the report on testing. There were some sections where we all needed to contribute our works and thoughts. For example: Roles, plans and progress, and group reflections and the other part were about solo work. While the other three members of the group were focused mainly on artifacts. Me along with Albert and Anin needed to work writing down every bit of work we are doing on the project and formatting it to make it visibly pleasant.  <br>

Even though most of the writing were very short in composition. I was assigned to do the skills and jobs. Which consists of writing about four jobs required to work as a team for a game creation.

 <h2>Scope and Limitations</h2>
 <p>Whilst our project plan is quite ambitious we have gone about setting our scope and relevant limitations that, whilst limited, will give people a very good idea and visualisation of what the final product would look and play like in its entirety. <br><br>



Given our top down 2D-rogue like shooter consists of 6 large and intricate levels the player will progress through, we have decided to present only one section of one of these levels as a working prototype, that is ACT 1- Ture Mines SCENE 4- Rust Zone Exploration. This is due to the fact that each level is just an altered adaption of their counterparts, only differing to each other in terms of visual elements (level & character design), enemy difficulty, weapons, map layout/items, cutscenes and lore.<br><br>



This single level will be quite simplistic but include a playable main character sprite (with hand drawn 8bit visual masks that adapt to directional inputs), a mole type enemy that will attack the player (also with respective hand drawn 8bit visual elements), a functional futuristic rifle & projectiles (including hand-drawn 8-bit visual elements), level obstacles/objects/background (visually masked using royalty-free sprites sourced online), etc.<br><br>



Moreover, two melee and two ranged weapons will be introducing in the rust zone exploration functional weapon with simple visual elements & projectiles, level obstacles and objects, and light in dark environments for tunnel exploration will be investigated.  (CHECK IF KELVIN ACTUALLY ADDED OR NOT)<br><br>



This is more so to give the player a good understanding of the game’s visuals and core gameplay, and if time permits will be preceded by an extremely simplistic starting game menu that will showcase the game title and allow players to start/quit the game.<br><br>



The level may also be physically divided up into numerous sections/rooms that represent our larger projected level design on a smaller scale (e.g. One room for lore, one room to find your hidden weapon, one room to defeat enemies).<br><br>



Our final game also consists of multiple cutscenes that play as the player progresses though each level, however, given our time limitations we will only be presenting 2 hand drawn concept sketches that depict a single frame which correctly represents the important points specific to our presented level (Mine caving in scene and Worm Boss scene). Concept art will also include a variety of the weapons that we hope to implement in Level 1 of our final game (Pickaxe, Extendable Drill, Futuristic Rifle), concept art for our Level 1 enemies (Mine Rat & Mine bat) and concept art visually outlining the level design of our finalised level 1. We hope this will allow test players to envision the final version of level 1 and what it would include.<br><br>



To accompany these concept drawings we will also be providing a in-depth game narrative/lore artifact which will outline the overarching story to the game and each level. This artifact will go into much detail about the background of our first level and all acts, whilst detail will be condensed and shorted for future levels.<br><br>

This will also give people a much more in-depth idea to the vision and overall narrative of the game and the way in which the embedded story will engage the player throughout their experience.<br><br>



We have decided to only include one sound loop for our game, which was designed and created by one of our group members using an audio creation software. We did not dedicate a strenuous amount of time to this area given we deemed it as not an integral part of our game and its focus. The 8-bit nature of the audio track has been designed to showcase the tone of the music implemented within our final game. In the final game we would obviously have additional music's that are unique to each level and incorporate sounds for character movements, weapons, enemies, title screen, cutscenes, etc.<br><br>

<h3>Previous Experiance</h3>
<p>All members had a strong-comprehensive understanding of Microsoft (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Teams, Outlook) and Google (Drive, Docs, Slides) applications before commencing A3 developed through our scholarly and working experience. All team members also had prior experience with HTML, CSS, and GitHub as a result of our last assignment (A2 – Our IT project) which aided with coding our website for A3. <br><br>

Team member Ivan has experience collaborating with various individuals to create illustrations and clothing for brands. He is currently working as a ‘Freelance Illustrator’, which takes commissions from individuals and in turn gives an illustration specifically designed to the commissioner’s needs. Skilled and experienced in using: Adobe Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint and Blender.
<br><br>

Whilst Kelvin was new to GameMaker Studio 2, he notes that his experience with coding programs and languages (e.g., HTML, Python, etc.) helped him immensely with understanding the coding concepts used whilst programming the game in GameMaker Studio 2.
<br><br>

Ron had specific experience with Samsung Notes throughout his studies and use of its integrated drawing functions in his pastime.
<br><br>

Anin already had specific experience with GarageBand developing instrumental beats as a personal hobby.

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Testing (also known as software testing or game testing) is an essential part of development. Game testing is a subset of game development, testing ensures the quality control of a video game. The key function of game testing is to discover and document defects or bugs. Interactive entertainment software testing is a highly technical field requiring computing expertise, analytic competence, critical evaluation skills, and endurance.[4][5] In recent years the field of game testing has come under fire for being extremely strenuous and unrewarding, both financially and emotionally. Software testing is the act of examining the artifacts and the behavior of the software under test by validation and verification. Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation. The way we will try to do the testing is by checking for bugs by ourselves. Since it is an exceedingly small project, we will not be doing any beta testing by sending the beta version of our game to anyone.

<h2>Timeframe</h2>
<p>For this section of the report, a hypothetical project timeframe of the outcome two-dimension Grounded Plains game development is illustrated below. The important information should come after the project handover. Week’s seven to twelfth is a summary of each team members proposed sections based on the plans and progress in the report. Therefore, more information regarding probable work allocations for each team member will be addressed. This is shown in two-week specific act focused periods out of the ten weeks additional development cycle. Lastly, as assignment two was due during week seven, the teams actual project commence date was in week eight. This allowed for a realistic development timeframe being a brainstorm game, setting and members roles divided up in week eight. Whilst week nine to week twelfth was the real development timeframe for assignment three.
</p>

<h2>Risks</h2>
<p>Some risks that can emerge during this assignment are, the difficulty of programming the software (game maker) to commit the desired actions within the time frame. As such platforms and engines could be poorly selected resulting in having inadequate experience or knowledge to perform the necessary feature. Another risk could be postponing bug fixes until it’s too late thus making it unpractical to resolve. Due to the enthusiasm of team members the project could get delayed as new features and mechanic may take a lot of time and effort which could suspend the completion of the model. Nevertheless, there is always the risk of the prototype not working due to unforeseen reason. However, in the case of this project succeeding the assignment other risks that could occur may include, unanticipated yearlong delays and miscommunication with group members resulting in unrecoverable losses. These are just some risks that could befall during this project.
</p>

<h2>Group process and communication</h2>
<p>The group were divided between the game development group which consisted of Ivan, Kelvin and Ron who oversaw artefact creation, while the rest; Albert, Anin and Altaf were responsible for report writing. Both groups strived to have numerous meetings however we refrained from conducting useless and redundant gathering that weren’t effective in conveying useful information. All communication relating to the assignment were done either in person or through teams, and almost all meetings were recorded for future playback. Individual questions or queries one had for their own group were asked through private chats as to declutter the general page for things that involved the entire group. Such as meeting schedules, completion of a task and the uptalking of another. Although we did plan to have at least two scheduled meetings either as an entire group or as a sub-group it was not always feasible, and thus was put off at times. If a group member were to be absent in meetings it was their responsibility to catch up to speed by either watching the recording or asking other group members. There hasn’t been an incident where a group member was unreachable however if such a situation were to arise, it would be noted through the group reflection and/or SparkPlus.
